            <div class="block3__text">The National Center of Folk Culture "Ivan Gonchar Museum" is a state-wide all-Ukrainian specialist in scientific research and research of cultural and well-known institutions, located in Kiev.</div>
            <div class="block3__text">Founded in 1993 on the basis of a private collection of Ivan Gonchar - an artist, sculptor and public figure.</div>
            <div class="block3__text">Ivan Gonchar began collecting his collection in the late 1950s. While traveling in Ukraine, the artist brought folk art objects made at different times, reflecting the cultural traditions of the country. For several decades of grandiose and painstaking collection and folklore work, Gonchar has put together a unique collection that became the beginning of the present Ukrainian Center of Folk Art. Ivan Gonchar.</div>
            <div class="block3__text">At a time when state museums emphasized the achievements of Soviet culture, Ivan Gonchar did not focus on the ideological nuances of creativity. He was interested in the fact that his collection reflects the traditions of Ukrainian folk art. As a result, this public museum has gained popularity not only in Ukraine but also abroad, and has become one of the hubs of the Sixties movement in Kiev.</div>
<div class="block3__text">The museum's collection includes more than 15,000 ethnographic and artistic units, including 2,7 thousand fabric samples (towels, shirts, outerwear, carpets, embroidery patterns), about 700 ceramics (pottery, children's toys, tiles), collection wooden carved things, metal and glass products, a collection of folk music instruments (kobza, bandura, cymbals, nozzles, wheel lyre, zither, goat, trembits, florist and others). A priority in the Museum's collection is the collection of Ukrainian folk paintings, in particular, the notorious Cossacks of the Mamaiv, as well as icons of folk writing (500 units). Professional paintings are presented in separate paintings. The Center also houses the personal library of I. Gonchar, which has 2 750 books.</div>
